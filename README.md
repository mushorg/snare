<b><i>Super Next generation Advanced Reactive honEypot</b></i>

About
---------
SNARE is a web application honeypot sensor attracting all sort of maliciousness from the Internet.

Documentation
--------------
The documentation can be found [here](http://snare.readthedocs.io).

Basic Concepts
--------------

- Surface first. Focus on the attack surface generation.
- Sensors and masters. Lightweight collectors (SNARE) and central decision maker (tanner).


Getting started
---------------

- You need Python3.6 to run SNARE
- This was tested with a recent Ubuntu based Linux.

#### Steps to setup
1. Get SNARE: `git clone https://github.com/mushorg/snare.git` and `cd snare`
2. Install requirements: `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setup snare: `sudo python3 setup.py install`
3. Clone a page: `sudo clone --target http://example.com`
4. Run SNARE: `sudo snare --port 8080 --page-dir example.com`
5. Test: Visit http://localhost:8080/index.html
6. (Optionally) Have your own [tanner](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner) service running.

#### Docker build instructions
1. Change current directory to `snare` project directory
2. `docker-compose build`
3. `docker-compose up`

More information about running `docker-compose` can be found [here.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)

[Note : Cloner clones the whole website, to restrict to a desired depth of cloning add `--max-depth` parameter]

You obviously want to bind to 0.0.0.0 and port 80 when running in <i>production</i>.

## Testing

In order to run the tests and receive a test coverage report, we recommend running `pytest`:


    pip install pytest pytest-cov
    sudo pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=snare snare/tests/


## Sample Output


```shell
    # sudo snare --port 8080 --page-dir example.com
